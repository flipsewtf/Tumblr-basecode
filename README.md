# Tumblr-basecode
A Rich, jQuery-free Tumblr Basecode template. Most of us theme-makers have used jQuery since the beginning of Tumblr because many scripts reqired it, but no more! well, if you want to, go ahead, but this is designed for you to not rely on jquery at all.

## Terms of use
+   This is a basecode template, not a full theme, so do not use it as such.
+   Make literally whatever you want with this, all I ask is a credit link in the code or on your credits page back to mournstera.tumblr.com.
+   I generally do not provide coding support (as per my FAQ,) But I did make this basecode so if you're a theme-maker, do not hesitate to ask.

## Credits
In this basecode I've used the following resources:

+ [@eggdesign](https://egg.design)'s [reverse compatible template](https://github.com/cornetespoir/npf-theme-base/blob/main/reverse-compatible-template.html)
+ [@eossa](https://eossa.studio)'s [reverse compatible template add-on](https://codepen.io/juliasteiwer/pen/yLGvKjV) *(if you have more than one photoset in a post, wrap photosets in divs)*
+ [@Spacetchi](https://spacetchi.tumblr.com)'s [5ppi Flexible (legacy) Photoset](https://github.com/Spacetchi/tumblr-flexible-photoset/tree/master)
+ [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com)
+ Tooltips by [Tippy.js](https://atomiks.github.io/tippyjs)
+ Dark mode by me [@mournstera](https://mournstera.tumblr.com) *(a modified version of [this plugin](https://mournstera.tumblr.com/plugins/darkmode))*
+ Custom like and reblog button, modified vesion of [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21708662/customise-tumblrs-new-like-button-iframe-likebutton/21715659#21715659)

## Notes

I've tried to include different kinds of JavaScript snippets such as a slide-down toggle menu, hide tumblr controls behind an icon, an update tab, tags on click, a dark mode toggle and shorten notecount, etc.

This basecode utilizes CSS Variables, (especially for the dark/light mode toggles, and it's also just easier in the long run) as well as Tippy.js for the tooltips.

Phosphor Icons has been initialized just as an icon example (especially for custom like and reblog icons).

I've made *a lot* of comments in this document, I'm sorry if it's a bit much, but I hope it's helpful!
      
If you don't already, please use chrome devtools or firefox inspect to really get a handle on this basecode, the classes and such.
